# tiny-spinner
Very simple and tiny spinner that never gets frozen. Less than 0.1kb when gzipped and minified!

## Customize
Fork the repo and edit `spinner.css` as you want. You can change its width, height, stroke size (by changing the border-width), animation speed (by changing the animation-duration), color (by changing the border-color) etc.

## Example
Open [the demo](//buzinas.github.io/tiny-spinner) and see how simple and beautiful it is.
